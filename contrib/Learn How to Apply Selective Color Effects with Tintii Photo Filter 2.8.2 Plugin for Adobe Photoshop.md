You can choose from presets such as **Black & White**, **Sepia**, **Red Boost**, **Blue Boost**, **Green Boost**, **Purple Boost**, **Yellow Boost**, **Cyan Boost**, **Magenta Boost**, or **Custom**.
 
## Step 3: Adjust the Color Settings Manually
 
If you are not satisfied with the preset, or if you want to fine-tune the effect, you can adjust the color settings manually using the sliders and buttons below the preset menu. The color settings are divided into three sections: **Hue**, **Saturation**, and **Threshold**.
 
The **Hue** section lets you control which colors are affected by the effect. You can use the sliders to increase or decrease the intensity of each color channel (red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, yellow). You can also use the buttons to select or deselect individual colors.
 
The **Saturation** section lets you control how much color is retained or removed from the affected areas. You can use the slider to increase or decrease the saturation level of the selected colors.
 
The **Threshold** section lets you control how much contrast is applied between the affected and unaffected areas. You can use the slider to increase or decrease the threshold level, which determines how much difference there is between similar colors.
 
## Step 4: Apply the Effect and Save Your Photo
 
Once you are happy with the color settings, you can apply the effect by clicking on the **OK** button at the bottom of the plugin's window. This will close the window and return you to Photoshop.
 
You can then save your photo as a new file or overwrite the original one. You can also use other tools in Photoshop such as brushes, masks and layers to further enhance your photo or create different effects.
